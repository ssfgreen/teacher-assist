# AGENTS.md

## Product and Development Specs

These live in ./specifications

There are four documents
- product-spec.md which defines the vision for the product
- dev-spec.md is the overall architecture and development ideas (open for tweaking)
- frontend.md is a list of frontend tasks loosely structured around different sprints
- backend.md is a list of backend tasks

## Verification steps

- Tests: Ensure critical path is always tested
- Linters: Always run linting

## Architecture, readme and specifications

- Keep an up-to-date ARCHITECTURE.md explaining the current architecture alongside key reasoning
- Keep an up-to-date README.md
- Keep specifications up to date with what has been done, including tasks that weren't previously in the spec document that were added along the way.
