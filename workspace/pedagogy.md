# Pedagogy

I use a combination of progressive, constructivist, and inquiry-based teaching methods.

I use a lot of scaffolding when teaching programming. I like to build up the complexity of tasks gradually, and provide students with small examples they can solve themselves.

I usually run my lessons with a starter activity, a main activity, and an exit quiz.

The starter activity is usually an interactive activity that gets the students thinking about the topic and reminds them of what they already know.

# Differentiation Strategies

I prefer to differentiate by content, rather than by method.
